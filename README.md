What's the idea? 

I like to trade digital currencies and have been successful to date in increasing the value of my investment.
 
However, reportedly, having knowledge of how much a given digital currency is being talked about and whether the commentary is generally positive/negative, could be a reasonable predictor of sentiment towards price increases/decreases longer term.

e.g. an increase in active subscribers to a Reddit thread for r/litecoin could be an indicator of intent to buy. So a sudden surge could be a good buy indicator. Of course intent of the messages users are posting will also contribute as well.
