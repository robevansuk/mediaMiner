What's the idea? 

I like to trade digital currencies and have been successful to date in increasing the value of my investment, however, it seems having knowledge of how much a given digital currency is being talked about and whether the commentary is generally positive/negative, could be a reasonable predictor of sentiment towards price increases/decreases.
